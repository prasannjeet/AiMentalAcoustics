\chapter*{\rm\bfseries Publications}
\label{ch:publications}

This part is optional, but it gives a nice touch to list all the publications (official venues down to poster sessions) throughout your PhD.

Keep this in the same style as publications in your academic CV: 
Conference / Year - Title - Authors. And here comes a sample ref for the bibliography: \cite{schiedermeier_fiddlr_2021} and \cite{schiedermeier_fiddlr_2021} and finally \cite{schiedermeier_fiddlr_2021}.
