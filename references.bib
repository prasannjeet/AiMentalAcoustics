	abstract = {Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) reduces complexity, improves Separation of Concerns and promotes reuse by structuring software development as a process of model production and refinement. Domain-Specific Modelling Languages and Aspect-Oriented Modelling techniques can reduce complexity and improve modularization of crosscutting concerns in situations where the features of general purpose modelling languages are not well aligned with the subject of study. In this article we present FIDDLR, a novel framework that integrates the ideas of Domain-Specific Modelling Languages, Concern-Oriented Reuse and MDE to modularize concerns that cross-cut multiple levels of abstraction of the software development process and streamline the reuse process. It also prescribes the integration of the different tooling along this process. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework and the potential for reduced complexity and leveraged reuse by building a reusable concern that exposes the services a system offers through a REST interface.},
